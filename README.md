## Introduction

You're looking at the Github repository of Team Kroket.

### What am I looking at?

This is Escaparade. Yes, Escaparade, or Escapãradè (??), all up to you. Escaparade is a multiplayer game by Team Kroket. We (Team Kroket) are five Computer Science students at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. For the course TI2806 - Contextproject our goal was to create a simple but fun multiplayer game, using an Oculus Rift a few Android powered mobile devices and our imagination.  

### Team w..wha?

Kroket! A kroket is a Dutch snack. Look it up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette#Netherlands)!

We picked this name because... we could. When signing up, we just picked a random food. Kroket it was. 

### How to play

You'll need:
- 1 Oculus Rift + computer
- 2 friends
- 2 Android Smartphones
- To be ready to laugh
