## Introduction

You're looking at the Github repository of Team Kroket.  Team Kroket is a group of five Computer Science students at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. For the course TI2806 - Contextproject our goal was to create a simple but fun multiplayer game, using an Oculus Rift, a few Android powered mobile devices and our imagination.  

### What am I looking at?

This is Escaparade. Yes, Escaparade, or Escapãradè (??), all up to you. Escaparade is a multiplayer game by Team Kroket.

### Team w..wha?

Kroket! A kroket is a Dutch snack. Look it up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette#Netherlands)!

We picked this name because... we could. When signing up, we just picked a random food. Kroket it was. 

### How to play

You'll need:
- 1 Oculus Rift connected to a computer
- 2 friends
- 2 Android Smartphones with the EscapeApp installed
- To get ready to laugh

#### Step 1: Installing the server
Install and run the EscapeHost application. The EscapeHost will listen (by defaulft) on port TCP/1234. If you are behind a NAT device, please configure it to forward incoming connections.
The server (EscapeHost) will automatically deal with all clients connecting and start the game when everyone is ready.

#### Step 2: Installing the VR client
Connect your Oculus Rift to a computer and install EscapeVR on this machine. This can be the same computer you're running the EscapeHost on.

#### Step 3: Installing the Mobile client
Install EscapeApp to at least two Android mobile devices. 

#### Step 4: Connect the clients to the server
Run EscapeVR and make sure it connects to the EscapeHost. 
On both Android devices, run the EscapeApp and make sure both are connected to the EscapeHost.

#### Step 5: Start the game
The EscapeHost will start the game when everyone is connected and ready to play.

Enjoy your game!
